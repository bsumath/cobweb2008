{"name":"Cobweb Plot 2008","tagline":"Java application for visualizing cobweb plots","body":"Cobweb Plot 2008\r\n================\r\nThis application can be used to visualize a cobweb plot of a function.\r\n\r\nIt was developed at [Ball State University](http://www.bsu.edu) and [Emporia State University](http://www.emporia.edu/) \r\nby [Richard Stankewitz](http://www.bsu.edu/web/rstankewitz/), [Joe Yanik](http://www.emporia.edu/math-cs/yanikjoe/),  and Ben Dean.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nCobweb Plot 2008 will run on systems with the following:\r\n\r\n* Java Runtime Environment version 6 or greater (JRE 8 recommended)\r\n* An OpenGL graphics card.\r\n* Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or Solaris operating systems\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation and Use\r\n--------------------\r\nCobweb Plot 2008 can be launched as a Java Web Start Application:\r\n\r\n* [Cobweb Plot 2008 - v1.1.0 (stable)](https://bsumath.github.io/cobweb2008/jnlp/cobweb2008.jnlp)\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\nDevelopment requirements:\r\n\r\n* Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher\r\n* Groovy 2.4.4 or higher\r\n* Gradle 2.6 or higher\r\n* IntelliJ IDEA (recommended IDE)\r\n\r\n### Build\r\nTo build Cobweb Plot 2008 run:\r\n\r\n    gradle build\r\n\r\n### Release\r\nTo release a new version of Cobweb Plot 2008, in addition to building the project you need to sign the jar files with a certificate. Rich Stankewitz keeps the BSU Math department's signing key.\r\n\r\nCreate a file in this repo named `keystore.properties` with the following:\r\n\r\n    storepass=the key store password goes here\r\n    storetype=pkcs12\r\n    keystore=D:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\the\\\\cert.p12\r\n    alias=the correct certificate alias\r\n    tsaurl=http://the.real.timestamp.authority.example.com\r\n\r\nRich Stankewitz has the correct values for the `keystore.properties` file. Once that file is created you can sign the jars and generate the jnlp content with:\r\n\r\n    gradle createWebstart\r\n\r\nThen the `build/jnlp` directory will contain\r\n\r\n* `cobweb2008.jnlp` - the file to launch Cobweb Plot 2008 via Java Web Start\r\n* `lib/*.jar` -  the signed jar files for Cobweb Plot 2008 and its dependencies\r\n\r\nThese files should then be committed on the [bsumath/cobweb2008@gh-pages](https://github.com/bsumath/cobweb2008/tree/gh-pages) branch.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n* [Richard Stankewitz](http://www.bsu.edu/web/rstankewitz/)\r\n* [Joe Yanik](http://www.emporia.edu/math-cs/yanikjoe/)\r\n* Ben Dean\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright © 2008-2016 Ball State University\r\n\r\nCopyright © Emporia State University\r\n\r\nCobweb Plot 2008 is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nCobweb Plot 2008 is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
